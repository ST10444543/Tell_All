    <h1>Community Workers Program</h1>
    <p>
        Local government in Mogale City recently launched the Community Workers Program in Kagiso, in partnership with the Private Sector. This was a new way of improving the Community Workers Programme for the better. The attendees included honorable members from local and national government, namely the Executive Mayor of Mogale City Mr. Danny Thupane, MM West Rand District Mr. Elias Koloi, and Deputy Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Mr. Parks Tau. The event was hosted at Chief Mogale Community Hall on Friday, 26 April 2024.

        In the early hours of Friday morning, community members of Kagiso packed the Chief Mogale Community Hall in full support of the community workers program.

        The initiative launch was meant to establish partnerships between the government and the private sector, particularly in favor of the workers. This new link aims to prepare and create a suitable environment for the community workersâ€™ program. Through this initiative, participants would receive training, develop new skills and ideas in the hope of starting their businesses, while some would be placed in the marketplace after completing the training. The Community Workers Programme has absorbed many unemployed individuals in the townships and enabled them to have a better life.

        The Community Workers Programme has always been the answer to high unemployment, benefiting both youth and elderly people for many years. It continues to be the best way of addressing social issues in the community. Many participants come from single-parent households, some are child-headed, while others rely on child grants and elderly grants, making this program a vital resource for many families.

        As Deputy Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Mr. Parks Tau said, "We as the local government are extremely happy to see the number of participants today, and we are saying to them, we are going to make sure that this program is going to create opportunities. We aim to better the lives of our people through such a program."

        At the end of the program, workers were able to ask questions, and community members also engaged with different stakeholders.
